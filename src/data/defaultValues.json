Make yourself exciting,get some treats out.\nEngage the puppy in a wee bit of training. This will help your dog's level of arousal (just excitement) to recede.\nThey can investigate the exciting thing IF APPROPRIATE but only when they are calm.",

    "infoText": "We all want the absolute best for our puppies. That means aiming for good health and a positive attitude (especially when getting together with other dog friends). Let's look at how to make sure your puppy gets the most out of early life.\nHelping your pup become a well-adjusted, resilient adult dog is much easier when you understand the development stages they'll experience as they grow. Happy and healthy puppies are usually those that have been strongly supported at each phase of development, with their specific needs being met along the way, helping them to complete all the puppy milestones.\nIf you have all the right information on your pupp's development, you'll find it easier to tailor your training to their particular life stage. By doing this, you'll help ensure your new family member is at home in the world - and whenever their behavior changes unexpectedly, you'll know exactly what to do."
